## Quant

**American Option Pricing**

* Built a versatile option pricing engine integrating Finite Difference Methods, Black-Scholes, and Binomial Trees to accurately price European and American options, with adaptive grids and early exercise handling.

**Black Scholes Model**

* Built an interactive Streamlit app to compute and visualize European call and put option prices using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, with dynamic inputs and LaTeX-rendered formulas.

**Mul Stra Portfolio Construction**

* Constructed and evaluated five portfolios on 9 U.S. stocks using 3 years of data, comparing allocation, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and risk contribution to highlight trade-offs in return and risk efficiency.

**3D Vol Surface**

* Built a dynamic Streamlit visualization of the SVI implied volatility surface using Plotly 3D, allowing interactive exploration of volatility smiles across maturities and log-moneyness with tunable SVI parameters.

## Data Science:

**Weather Forecast Dashboard**

* Built an interactive global weather app in Streamlit using Open-Meteo API with real-time forecasts and dynamic visualizations.

**Titanic Data Explorer**

* Created a multi-tab Streamlit dashboard to analyze Titanic survival data with interactive Plotly charts and user-driven filters.

**Health and Wealth of Nations**

* Interactive visualization showing the relationship between income per capita and life expectancy over time.

**Interactive XGBoost Classifier with Panel**

* Built an interactive Panel app to train and visualize XGBoost classifiers on the Iris dataset, allowing real-time hyperparameter tuning with dynamic accuracy feedback and responsive UI elements.


## Computer Science:

**MiniShell (C)**

* Developed a Unix-like shell supporting built-in commands, I/O redirection, and process control.

**Inversion Counter (C++)**

* Implemented a mergesort-based algorithm to efficiently count inversions in integer arrays.

**Falstad Circuit simulation**
