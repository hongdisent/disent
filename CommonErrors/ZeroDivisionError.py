"""
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

This error occurs when you attempt to divide a number by zero which is mathematically undefined.
"""

"""
Video Script:
1. Begin by saying: "\ we're looking at a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError."
2. Explain: "This error happens when you try to divide any number by zero. Python doesn't like this because, in math, dividing by zero is undefined."
3. Demonstrate: "Let me show you an example. Here's a snippet of code that triggers the error."
4. Run the code and explain: "As you can see, Python raises a ZeroDivisionError and stops the program from continuing."
5. Wrap up with: "To avoid this, make sure you're checking if the denominator is zero before performing division."
